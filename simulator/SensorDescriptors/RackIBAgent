Rack level IB agent has devices of CMC+SW.  In our example we have 8 of them named
r1i0c-SW0
r1i0c-SW1
r1i0c-SW2
r1i0c-SW3
r1i1c-SW0
r1i1c-SW1
r1i1c-SW2
r1i1c-SW3
Each device has 18 sensors as describe in the InfinibandSensors.json file.

In this case there will be 1 Agent uuid, 8 Device uuids and 136 Sensor uuids.
