SINGLE MACHINE setup... ( RAM qty=32GB, can run with 16GB but will be hard .... cpu-cores: 8 true cores, 4 is doable but hard on the system. )

- install docker (check it works with "docker run hello-world")

# NO NO NOnote: need /etc/docker/daemon.json for PROXY-challenged setups

- install docker-compose 1.25.5

- sudo curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.25.5/docker-compose-`uname -s`-`uname -m` -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

- make it executable

- chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

- cd playbooks

- cp playbooks/km.conf ~/km.conf, then edit it to match your setup

###TBD SEB: add the unset proxy option in km.conf from my laptop..

- create a swarm cluster
-  docker swarm init --advertise-addr x.y.z.t (where x.y.z.t is a local IP address to attach to)
- label your local machine with all KM labels (shell syntax)
- for label in broker-1 broker-2 broker-3 fanin registry framework injectors test-tools supervisory_cloud; do docker node update --label-add $label=true `hostname`; done

- run setup.sh -r: this will start two registry, a mirror registry and a proxy registry

- run setup.sh -b: this will build the stack from the internet, can be very long depending on internet connection

- run setup.sh -d: this will deploy all containers to the single system.
